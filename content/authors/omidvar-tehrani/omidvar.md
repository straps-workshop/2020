## Enabling Interactivity between Human and Artificial Intelligence



 Interactivity is to enable users to interact with their data and data systems effectively. It goes beyond efficiency measures and aims to make data usable for users. There exist different needs to interact with data and seek relevant information for an improved decision making process, such as shopping online, finding risky insured drivers, and building expert committees. In this talk, we discuss challenges and opportunities to substantiate interactivity in artificial intelligence applications. We begin by introducing the status quo, i.e., AI systems in which the user is left out of the loop, such as automated end-to-end ML pipelines, which lack personalization, customization, and explanation. Then we present a “guidance” approach in the form of a mixed-initiative system, where both human intelligence and artificial intelligence assist each other through iterative interactions to achieve higher levels of effectiveness. Next we describe how Reinforcement Learning helps model these interactions and how learned policies can augment the quality of interactions. Last, we discuss some results obtained so far and some future directions.
