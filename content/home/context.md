More than ever, reducing the cost of data integration by efficiently evaluating queries is an important challenge, given that today the economic cost in computing cycles (see your cloud invoice); and in energy consumption and the performance required for some critical tasks have become important. Besides, new applications require solving even more complex queries including millions of sources, and data with high levels of volume and variety. These new challenges call for intelligent processes that can learn from previous experiences, that can be adaptable to changing requirements and dynamic execution contexts.

This workshop follows a first successful edition in conjunction with ICSOC 2019 in Toulouse that led to a vivid program with interesting discussion ([STRAPS 2019](https://straps-workshop.github.io/2019)). **The second edition of the workshop STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data produced under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, analytical queries**. These queries must cope to quality preferences associated with providers, algorithms and data trust. New scales in volume, velocity and value associated with integrated data collections require adapted solutions providing computing, storage and processing services potentially deployed on different highly distributed infrastructures and target architectures. With service, data and algorithms stemming from different and potentially huge numbers of providers, properties like provenance, quality and trust, arise as key properties to be quantified, evaluated and exposed to data consumers. How can data integration in such conditions be smart? This is the key question to be discussed by workshop participants.

Underlying approaches and algorithms continue to evolve particularly given the new levels of volume, velocity and value associated with data. Contemporary infrastructures for dealing with data are deployed in heterogeneous target architectures like cloud, multi-cloud, Internet of Things consisting of sensors and server farms deployed around the world. These infrastructures go beyond classic data management solutions and evolve towards different stacks configurations (data processing systems "a la carte").  They need to cope with new notions of scalability and of resources consumption guided by economic models, service level agreements and other quality warranties. 

##### OBJECTIVE

The workshop STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data stemming from different providers and produced under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, analytical queries ensuring providers, algorithms and data trust.
